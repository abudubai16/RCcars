**Brief Introduction to the Project**
• The server connects a remotely controlled car that uses an ESP32, with its user.

• This specific website was made for handling multiple such connections for conducting a race.

• The admin controls when the race has begun, when new players can join and end the session of current players.

• Each car also gives video input to the server and the player can run the car using the video input.

• This gives the user the ability to connect to the car from anywhere in the world, provided the server is deployed.
